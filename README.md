# AIM OF MAKING THIS APP
This aims to revolutionize the rural farming communities in India by providing seamless access to vital agricultural information. We envisage "Krishi Mitra" as a user-centered information system with 
an easy to use, efficient, scalable, community oriented design that aims to promote professional growth of the rural farmers. The user interface of Krishi- Mitra is 
thoughtfully designed using audio- visual-textual cues and familiar high affordance metaphors that are easily understood not just by literate but also by the illiterate and 
semi-literate farmers. It supplements direct two-way interaction between farmers and agricultural experts, thus eliminating possible exploitation of farmers through 
deceitful intermediaries. To scaffold this design endeavor, we conducted rapid ethnographic research to uncover a deeper understanding of the information needs 
of rural farmers in two different districts in the State of Maharashtra in India. In this paper, we introduce the interface design of Krishi-Mitra realized through a 
conceptual prototype and discuss qualitative usability testing results of the User Interface of Krishi-Mitra conducted with five farmers in the Ahmadnagar district of 
Maharashtra in India. We believe that the findings and discussions from this case study will prove useful to interface designers and user researchers to inform and 
guide future work in this important area.
